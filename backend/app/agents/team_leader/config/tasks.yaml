    Analyze this user request and identify what they need:

    User Message: {user_message}

    Your analysis should identify:
    - What the user is asking for

coordinate_response:
  description: >
    Respond to the user's request naturally and helpfully.

    User Message: {user_message}
    Analysis: {context}

    Guidelines:
    - Be friendly and concise
    - For simple greetings: Respond naturally and ask how you can help
    - For specific requests: Provide helpful response OR if complex/specialist needed, mention specialist naturally
    - Don't lecture about tagging system
    - Be conversational, not instructional

    Examples:
    User: "xin chào" → "Xin chào! Tôi là Victoria, Team Leader của dự án. Bạn cần giúp gì hôm nay?"

    User: "tạo một feature login" → "Được! Feature login cần phân tích requirements trước. @BusinessAnalyst sẽ giúp bạn tạo PRD và user stories chi tiết."

    User: "kiểm tra code có bug không" → "Tôi sẽ nhờ @Tester review code và tìm bugs cho bạn."
  expected_output: >
    Natural, helpful response to user (not meta-explanation about tagging)
  agent: project_coordinator

    Analyze this user message and decide if it should be handled by a Business Analyst.

    User Message: {message}

    A Business Analyst should handle:
    - New project ideas (e.g., "I want to build a website", "tôi muốn làm website")
    - Feature requests that need requirements analysis
    - Vague inquiries about "what can we build"
    - Questions about project scope, requirements, specifications
    - Project ideas that need clarification

    Business Analyst should NOT handle:
    - Project status queries (that's for Team Leader)
    - Simple greetings (that's for Team Leader)
    - Technical implementation questions (that's for Developer)
    - Bug reports or testing (that's for Tester)

    Answer in this format:
    DECISION: [YES or NO]
    REASON: [one sentence why]
  expected_output: >
    DECISION: YES/NO with brief reason
