# Theme Factory Knowledge Base

This knowledge base provides a curated collection of professional font and color themes. Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact to ensure a consistent and polished look.

## Purpose

To apply consistent, professional styling to artifacts such as presentation slide decks, documents, or reports. Each theme includes:
- A cohesive color palette with specific hex codes.
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text.
- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences.

## Usage Instructions

To apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:

1.  **List available themes**: Inform the user about the available themes listed below.
2.  **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme they would like to apply.
3.  **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation of the chosen theme.
4.  **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, retrieve the theme's details from its corresponding file in the `themes/` directory and apply the specified colors and fonts to the artifact.
** AUTO SELECT THE THEME IN CASE USER DID NOT ANSWER **

## Themes Available

The following 10 themes are available, with details for each located in the `themes/` directory:

1.  **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme.
2.  **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors.
3.  **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones.
4.  **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale.

## Theme Details

Each theme is defined in a corresponding `.md` file within the `themes/` directory. Each file contains:
- A description of the theme's identity.
- **Color Palette**: A list of hex codes for primary, secondary, and accent colors.
- **Typography**: Font pairings for headers and body text.
- **Best Used For**: Suggestions on where the theme is most effective.

## Application Process

After a preferred theme is selected:

1.  Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory.
2.  Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the artifact.
3.  Ensure proper contrast and readability.
4.  Maintain the theme's visual identity across all elements.

## Create Your Own Theme

If none of the existing themes are suitable, you can create a custom theme. Based on user input (e.g., brand guidelines, mood, topic), generate a new theme definition similar to the existing ones.

1.  Give the new theme a descriptive name.
2.  Choose appropriate colors and fonts based on the user's description.
3.  Generate the theme file and show it to the user for review and verification.
4.  Once approved, apply the new theme as described above.
