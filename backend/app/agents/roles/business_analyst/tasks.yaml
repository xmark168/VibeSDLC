  description: >
    You are conducting a requirements gathering session with a user who wants to build software.

    Current conversation context:
    {conversation_context}

    User's latest message:
    {user_message}

    Current turn: {turn_count}
    Total requirements collected: {total_requirements}

    Your job is to:
    1. Extract ALL requirements from the user's message
    2. Return them in a structured format (see expected_output)
    3. Provide a conversational response

    Analyze the user's message and identify requirements in these categories:
    - Problem & Goals: What problem are they solving? What are the business objectives?
    - Users & Stakeholders: Who will use this? What are their roles and needs?
    - Features & Scope: What features do they need? What's in/out of scope?

    If the user's message contains NO new requirements (e.g., just "ok", "yes", "that's enough"),
    return an empty requirements section.

    Response rules:
    - ALWAYS ask clarifying questions to gather more details unless you have sufficient requirements
    - Minimum requirements to end gathering: (turn >= 3 AND total_requirements >= 6) OR total_requirements >= 8
    - When the above condition is met: Thank them, summarize what you've gathered, and tell them to type 'next' to create the PRD
    - Otherwise: Ask 1-2 specific clarifying questions about missing information

    Questions to ask if information is missing:
    - Target users: Who will use this system? (customers, admins, etc.)
    - Key features: What main features do you need?
    - Business goals: What problems are you trying to solve?
    - Technical requirements: Any specific integrations or platforms?

    When ending the requirements gathering (condition met):
    - Thank the user for the information
    - Briefly summarize the key requirements collected (list 3-5 main points)
    - Add this instruction at the end: "Nhập 'next' để tạo PRD." (or in English: "Type 'next' to create the PRD.")

    IMPORTANT: Always respond in the SAME LANGUAGE as the user.

phase_evaluation_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate if the Analysis phase has collected sufficient requirements to proceed to the Solution phase.

    CRITICAL: You MUST use the State Manager Tool to check actual requirements. DO NOT rely on the summary text below.

    STEP 1 - CHECK COMPLETENESS (MANDATORY):
    You MUST call the State Manager Tool:
    Tool: State Manager Tool
    Parameters:
      - action: 'check_complete'

    This will return the ACTUAL count of requirements in each category.

    STEP 2 - ANALYZE THE TOOL RESULT:
    Based on the tool's response, evaluate:
    - Do we have at least 2 requirements in each category (problem_goals, users_stakeholders, features_scope)?
    - OR do we have at least 8 total requirements across all categories?
    - Are the requirements specific and actionable?

    STEP 3 - MAKE DECISION:
    - If criteria met: DECISION: READY
    - If criteria NOT met: DECISION: NOT_READY

    IMPORTANT: Base your decision ONLY on the tool result, NOT on the text summary below.

    Current requirements summary (for reference only):
    {requirements_summary}
  expected_output: >
    A clear decision in this format:

    DECISION: [READY or NOT_READY]

    REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining why, citing ACTUAL numbers from the tool]

# ==================== SOLUTION DESIGN PHASE - SINGLE TASK FOR FLOWS ====================

solution_design_flows_task:
  description: >
    Design all BUSINESS FLOWS (user journeys) for the solution.

    CRITICAL: You are a BUSINESS ANALYST, NOT a technical architect.

    PRD (defines WHAT to build):
    {product_brief}

    Requirements to analyze:
    {requirements_summary}

    Current Solution (if refining):
    {current_solution}

    Revision Feedback (if any):
    {revision_feedback}

    YOUR JOB: Analyze the PRD and identify ALL major user journeys/workflows.

    REFINEMENT MODE: If current_solution is provided (not "None"), you are in REFINEMENT mode.
    In this mode, you must:
    1. Read the current_solution carefully to understand existing business flows
    2. Read the revision_feedback to understand what needs to be changed
    3. Make ONLY the changes requested in revision_feedback
    4. Keep all other flows EXACTLY as they were
    5. Example: If feedback says "ở luồng đăng ký, không cần thêm xác nhận đồng ý điều khoản" → Remove that step from the registration flow, keep other flows unchanged

    STEP 1 - ANALYZE AND PLAN:
    Review the PRD to identify ALL major flows needed:
    - What are the main user journeys? (e.g., customer purchasing a book, admin managing inventory)
    - What are the key workflows that achieve product goals?
    - What processes span across the system?

    STEP 2 - DESIGN FLOWS:
    For each flow, define:
    - name: Flow name (e.g., "Book Purchase Flow")
    - description: What this flow accomplishes
    - steps: Array of detailed steps from start to finish
    - actors: Array of actors involved (users, systems, external services)

    CRITICAL REFINEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
    If you are in REFINEMENT MODE (current_solution is not "None"):
    - START with the current_solution as your base
    - ONLY change the specific flow(s) mentioned in revision_feedback
    - If feedback says "ở luồng X, bỏ step Y" → Find flow X, remove step Y, keep ALL other flows unchanged
    - If feedback says "thêm luồng Z" → Add flow Z, keep ALL other flows unchanged
    - If feedback says "sửa luồng A" → Modify flow A as requested, keep ALL other flows unchanged
    - DO NOT regenerate all flows - just apply the specific changes
    - All unchanged flows must remain IDENTICAL to current_solution

    CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
    You MUST write ALL business flows in the SAME LANGUAGE as the PRD.
    - If the PRD is in Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt), write ALL flow names, descriptions, steps, and actors in Vietnamese.
    - If the PRD is in English, write ALL flow names, descriptions, steps, and actors in English.
    - Check the language of the PRD carefully and use that exact language.
    - DO NOT translate or mix languages. Maintain 100% language consistency.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Design ALL flows at once
    - Focus on complete end-to-end user journeys
    - Include all steps from start to finish
    - Identify all actors (users, systems, external services)
    - Your output will be automatically parsed as FlowsOutput Pydantic model
  expected_output: >
    A complete list of all business flows in the solution. Each flow must have:
    - name: Flow name
    - description: What this flow accomplishes
    - steps: List of detailed steps
    - actors: List of actors involved

    Current solution components:
    {solution_summary}

    STEP 3 - ANALYZE:
    - Does the solution support all Product Goals defined in the Brief?
    - Does every requirement have corresponding business flows?
    - Are all Target Users from the Brief considered in the flows?
    - Does the solution stay within the defined Scope from the Brief?
    - Are major user journeys documented as business flows?
    - Are there any gaps or missing pieces?

    STEP 4 - PROVIDE VALIDATION REPORT:
    Based on your analysis, provide the final validation report (do NOT make more tool calls after this).

    If gaps found: Clearly identify what's missing and recommend additions.
    If complete: Confirm solution is ready for backlog creation.

    CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:

product_brief_creation_task:
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive PRD based on requirements analysis.
    This brief defines WHAT needs to be built, and will guide the Solution Design phase (HOW to build it).

    Requirements:
    {requirements_summary}

    Current PRD (if refining):
    {current_brief}

    Revision Feedback (if any):
    {revision_feedback}

    YOUR JOB: Analyze requirements and create a PRD with all required sections.

    REFINEMENT MODE: If current_brief is provided (not "None"), you are in REFINEMENT mode.
    In this mode, you must:
    1. Read the current_brief carefully to understand what already exists
    2. Read the revision_feedback to understand what needs to be changed
    3. Make ONLY the changes requested in revision_feedback
    4. Keep all other sections EXACTLY as they were in current_brief
    5. Example: If feedback says "bỏ X ở OUT OF SCOPE" → Remove X from OUT OF SCOPE section

    STEP 1 - ANALYZE REQUIREMENTS:
    Review the requirements gathered during the analysis phase.
    Extract key information needed for each PRD section:
    - What problem are we solving? (from problem_goals)
    - Who are the users and what do they need? (from users_stakeholders)
    - What features should be included? (from features_scope)
    - What are the success criteria and objectives?

    STEP 2 - CREATE PRODUCT BRIEF:
    Design the PRD with these sections:
    - product_summary: Brief overview (2-3 sentences). Use clear, concise language.
    - problem_statement: What problem does this solve? Why is it needed? Write in short paragraphs (max 3-4 sentences each) separated by newlines.
    - target_users: Who will use this product? Format as numbered list, one user group per line.
    - product_goals: Key objectives and success criteria. Format as numbered list with clear goals.
    - scope: What's IN SCOPE and what's OUT OF SCOPE. Separate sections clearly.
    - revision_count: Set to 0 (or increment if revision_feedback provided)

    FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use \n for line breaks within each field to improve readability
    - Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) or bullet points (-, •) where appropriate
    - Keep paragraphs short (max 3-4 sentences before a line break)
    - Separate major sections within a field with double line breaks (\n\n)
    - Target Users: Format as numbered list, one user group per line
    - Product Goals: Format as numbered list with clear, measurable goals
    - Scope: Clearly separate IN SCOPE and OUT OF SCOPE sections

    CRITICAL REFINEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
    If you are in REFINEMENT MODE (current_brief is not "None"):
    - START with the current_brief as your base
    - ONLY change what is explicitly mentioned in revision_feedback
    - If feedback says "bỏ X" or "remove X" → DELETE X from the document
    - If feedback says "thêm Y" or "add Y" → ADD Y to the document
    - If feedback says "sửa Z thành W" or "change Z to W" → REPLACE Z with W
    - DO NOT rewrite or regenerate the entire brief - just apply the changes
    - All unchanged sections must remain IDENTICAL to current_brief

    CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
    You MUST write the PRD in the SAME LANGUAGE as the requirements above.
    - If the requirements are in Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt), write the ENTIRE PRD in Vietnamese.
    - If the requirements are in English, write the ENTIRE PRD in English.
    - Check the language of the {requirements_summary} carefully and use that exact language.
    - DO NOT translate or mix languages. Maintain 100% language consistency.

    IMPORTANT: ALL fields are REQUIRED and must be filled with meaningful content based on requirements.
    Do NOT leave any field empty or with placeholder text.
  expected_output: >
    A complete PRD with all required sections filled with meaningful content from the requirements.
    The output will be automatically parsed as ProductBriefData Pydantic model.
  agent: product_brief_writer

product_brief_review_task:
  description: >
    Review the PRD for quality, clarity, and alignment with requirements.
    This brief will guide the Solution Design phase, so it must be complete and clear.

    STEP 1 - GET BRIEF:
    Use the Documentation Manager Tool to get the current brief:
    Tool: Documentation Manager Tool
    Parameters:
      - action: 'get_brief'

    Requirements:
    {requirements_summary}

    STEP 2 - EVALUATE:
    - Is the Product Summary clear and concise?
    - Does the Problem Statement accurately reflect the requirements?
    - Are Target Users well-defined based on stakeholder requirements?
    - Are Product Goals specific and measurable?
    - Is the Scope clear about what's included and excluded?
    - Does everything align with the requirements and solution?

    STEP 3 - PROVIDE REVIEW:
    Based on your evaluation, provide the final review report (do NOT make more tool calls after this).
    Provide specific, actionable feedback for improvements.

    CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
    You MUST write your review in the SAME LANGUAGE as the PRD you are reviewing.

epic_story_creation_task:
  description: >
    Create Epics and User Stories based on the PRD and Business Flows, organized by feature domain.

    PRD:
    {product_brief}

    Business Flows (from Solution Design):
    {solution_summary}

    Current Product Backlog (if refining):
    {current_backlog}

    Revision Feedback (if any):
    {revision_feedback}

    YOUR JOB: Design comprehensive Epics and User Stories based on user goals and journeys.

    REFINEMENT MODE: If current_backlog is provided (not "None"), you are in REFINEMENT mode.
    In this mode, you must:
    1. Read the current_backlog carefully to understand existing epics and stories
    2. Read the revision_feedback to understand what needs to be changed
    3. Make ONLY the changes requested in revision_feedback
    4. Keep all other epics and stories EXACTLY as they were
    5. Example: If feedback says "thêm story cho X" → Add story for X, keep others unchanged

    STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND PRODUCT CONTEXT:
    Review the PRD to understand:
    - Problem Statement: What problem are we solving?
    - Target Users: Who will use this system and what are their needs?
    - Product Goals: What are the success criteria?
    - Scope: What's in-scope vs out-of-scope?

    STEP 2 - ANALYZE BUSINESS FLOWS:
    Review the Business Flows to understand:
    - What are the main user journeys?
    - What steps do users take to achieve their goals?
    - What value does each flow provide?

    STEP 3 - IDENTIFY FEATURE DOMAINS:
    Based on Product Goals and user journeys, identify 3-5 major feature domains (e.g., Product Discovery, Shopping Cart, Order Management, Payment Processing).

    STEP 4 - DESIGN EPICS:
    For EACH feature domain, create an Epic with:
    - id: Epic ID (e.g., "epic-1", "epic-2")
    - name: Epic name
    - description: What this epic delivers
    - domain: Feature domain name

    STEP 5 - DESIGN USER STORIES:
    For EACH business flow step, create User Stories that enable that step.
    IMPORTANT: Consider Target Users from PRD when writing stories (use correct roles like "customer", "admin", "warehouse manager").

    APPLY INVEST PRINCIPLES TO EVERY STORY:

    Each story must have:
    - epic_id: ID of the epic this story belongs to
    - title: In format "As a [role from Target Users], I want [feature] so that [benefit aligned with Product Goals]"
    - description: Detailed description of the story
    - acceptance_criteria: List of criteria in Given-When-Then format

    INVEST FIELDS (REQUIRED):
    - story_points: Estimate using Fibonacci (1,2,3,5,8,13). Use estimation guide from your backstory.
        - 1 = 1 day (simple UI, basic CRUD)
        - 2 = 2 days (standard feature)
        - 3 = 3 days (some complexity)
        - 5 = 1 week (complex feature)
        - 8 = 2 weeks (very complex - consider splitting)
        - 13 = TOO LARGE (MUST split into smaller stories)
    - priority: Assign based on Product Goals
        - High: Must have for MVP, critical to goals, blocking
        - Medium: Should have, important but not critical
        - Low: Nice to have, can defer
    - dependencies: List story IDs this depends on (keep MINIMAL for Independence)
        - Try to have 0 dependencies
        - Max 2-3 dependencies per story
        - Avoid circular dependencies

    Target: Create at least 10-15 user stories total covering all business flows and product goals.
    Ensure stories align with Product Goals and stay within defined Scope.

    CRITICAL REFINEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
    If you are in REFINEMENT MODE (current_backlog is not "None"):
    - START with the current_backlog as your base
    - ONLY change what is explicitly mentioned in revision_feedback
    - If feedback says "bỏ epic X" or "remove epic X" → DELETE epic X
    - If feedback says "thêm story Y" or "add story Y" → ADD story Y
    - If feedback says "sửa story Z" or "modify story Z" → MODIFY story Z as requested
    - DO NOT regenerate the entire backlog - just apply the changes
    - All unchanged epics and stories must remain IDENTICAL

    CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
    You MUST write Epics and User Stories in the SAME LANGUAGE as the PRD and Requirements.
    - If the PRD is in Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt), write ALL epics and stories in Vietnamese.
    - If the PRD is in English, write ALL epics and stories in English.
    - Check the language of the PRD carefully and use that exact language.
    - User story format: "Với vai trò [role], tôi muốn [feature] để [benefit]" (Vietnamese) or "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]" (English)
    - DO NOT translate or mix languages. Maintain 100% language consistency.

    IMPORTANT: Create comprehensive epics and stories covering ALL user journeys and product goals.
    Every story MUST have story_points and priority assigned.
  expected_output: >
    A complete backlog with both epics and stories.
    Output format:
    - epics: List of all epics organized by feature domain
    - stories: List of all user stories with acceptance criteria

    The output will be automatically parsed as BacklogOutput Pydantic model.
  agent: epic_story_writer

backlog_validation_task:
  description: >
    Validate that Epics and Stories comprehensively cover the PRD scope and business flows.

    STEP 1 - GET DOCUMENTATION:
    Use the Documentation Manager Tool to get current documentation:
    Tool: Documentation Manager Tool
    Parameters:
      - action: 'get_documentation'

    PRD:
    {product_brief}

    Business Flows (Solution Design):
    {solution_summary}

    STEP 2 - ANALYZE COVERAGE:
    - Does every business flow have corresponding user stories?
    - Are epics properly organized by feature domain?
    - Do all stories align with Target Users defined in PRD?
    - Do stories support Product Goals?
    - Are all in-scope features from PRD covered?
    - Are there any out-of-scope features included by mistake?
    - Do all stories have clear acceptance criteria?
    - Are there any gaps or missing stories?

    STEP 2.5 - VALIDATE INVEST COMPLIANCE (CRITICAL):
    For EVERY story, check:

    1. INDEPENDENT - Dependencies check:
       - Count dependencies per story
       - Flag stories with >3 dependencies as "too coupled"
       - Check for circular dependencies (A→B→A)
       - Recommend refactoring if many stories are interdependent

    2. NEGOTIABLE - Priority check:
       - Verify ALL stories have priority field
       - Check priority is one of: High, Medium, Low
       - Flag stories missing priority

    3. VALUABLE - Value check:
       - Verify story title includes "so that [benefit]"
       - Check benefit aligns with Product Goals

    4. ESTIMABLE - Story points check:
       - Verify ALL stories have story_points field
       - Check story_points is valid Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
       - Flag stories missing story_points
       - Flag invalid estimates (not Fibonacci)

    5. SMALL - Size check:
       - Flag stories with 8 points as "Large - consider splitting"
       - Flag stories with 13 points as "TOO LARGE - MUST split"

    6. TESTABLE - Acceptance criteria check:
       - Verify all stories have acceptance_criteria
       - Check criteria follow Given-When-Then format

    INVEST RED FLAGS (report these in validation):
    - Stories missing story_points
    - Stories with invalid story_points (e.g., 4, 6, 7, 10)
    - Stories with 8+ points (too large)
    - Stories missing priority
    - Stories with >3 dependencies
    - Circular dependencies detected
    - Missing acceptance criteria

    STEP 3 - PROVIDE VALIDATION:
    Based on your analysis, provide the final validation report (do NOT make more tool calls after this).

    CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
    You MUST write your validation report in the SAME LANGUAGE as the Epics and Stories you are validating.
    - If the Epics and Stories are in Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt), write your ENTIRE validation report in Vietnamese.
    - If the Epics and Stories are in English, write your ENTIRE validation report in English.
    - DO NOT translate or mix languages. Maintain 100% language consistency with the backlog.
